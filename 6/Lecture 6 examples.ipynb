    "\n",
    "Global and static variables are stored in a data segment and exist for the entire duration of the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "This matters in **C** because it exposes addresses of variables and does not automatically move or resize objects, understanding where your variables live in memory is essential to avoid bugs like uninitialized pointers and memory leaks. It also matters for performance: stack allocation is usually very fast, while heap allocation is more flexible but costs extra time and can fragment memory if used poorly."
